#Neural networks in acute toxicity modeling

This is a repository for my bachelors thesis. It contains the files used to generate graphs, plots and tabels used in the thesis. 
The code is used by running Main.py and including the parameters: number of trials for Optuna, the folder name where to generate the data and methods for feature selection.
Afterwards it is possible to run Analysis.py to generate automatic analysis on the generated information.
